For a developer like us, would own lots of email ids for various purposes. Remembering the email ids and its passwords is a hectic job(For myself :D). We tend to forget the passwords.\r\n\r\nThis is application would remember those passwords for you. Though you may have to remember one password to access this application(No way out :D).\r\n\r\n**The Key Depot** is in its infancy and will grow bigger in future(obviously! :D);\r\n\r\nCheers;\r\n\r\n",
